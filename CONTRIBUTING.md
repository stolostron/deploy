# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need your help to make this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us on Slack ([#forum-acm](https://coreos.slack.com/archives/CTDEY6EEA) - private RedHat only link at this time). We want to help answer your questions about the `Open Cluster Management` organization.

For documentation please see our 'work-in-progress' [docs](https://github.com/stolostron/rhacm-docs/blob/doc_prod/README.md). Open a [doc issue](https://github.com/stolostron/rhacm-docs/issues/new/choose) for any problems you may find, or clarifications you might suggest.
